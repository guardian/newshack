<h1>Story: US debt crisis</h1>

<section class="module-latest">
    <h2>Latest update</h2>
    <p>
    The <strong>US Congress</strong> passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week
    crisis that has closed large portions of the government and revealed deep divisions in the Republican party.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    The great US government shutdown of 2013 began, said the Iowa senator Tom Harkin, "like a scene from the Hollywood western High Noon". There was the
    Democrat sheriff Barack Obama, squared off against a gang of southern gunslingers, both sides determined not to give an inch and prepared to blow each
    other's brains out to get what they came for.

        <p>
        A first-term Republican senator from Texas and Tea Party favorite. Just before the shutdown, he railed against Obamacare on the Senate floor in a
        publicity-seeking speech that lasted more than 21 hours.

        <h3>Barack Obama <small class="dem">Democrat</small></h3>
        <p>
        Early on, the president took a position that he would not negotiate at all while the shutdown remained in effect, or while Congress continued to
        threaten a default. Politically, he had little to lose from severing communications, because they were already blocking the two other things that
        matter to him - gun control and immigration - and he was therefore even more reluctant to give up his only other big domestic achievement by delaying
        Obamacare.

        <p>
        The Speaker of the House's weakness as party leader was a major factor in the shutdown. His last-minute deal with vice-president Joe Biden averted the
        "fiscal cliff" standoff in January, but angered many on the right of his party. This time, he had little support from majority leader Eric Cantor, who
        is thought to be angling for his job, and Republican whip Kevin McCarthy, who is close to the Tea Party.

        <p>The short-term threat of a US government default is off the table for now. Under the deal, the debt ceiling raise will only last until 7 February next year. The government will reopen, but will only be funded through until 15 January next year – so we could see a repeat of all of this in three months.</p>
