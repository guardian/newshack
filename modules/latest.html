    <p>
    The <strong>US Congress</strong> passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week
    crisis that has closed large portions of the government and revealed deep divisions in the Republican party.
    </p>
    <p>
    President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> quickly signed the spending measure, a temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014. The bill passed easily
    with broad bipartisan support in the <strong>Senate</strong>, where <strong>Democratic</strong> and <strong>Republican</strong> leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier.

    "The real story is not revealed by people's view of the politicians; it's contained in the indices of economic sentiment. Gallup finds that Americans'
    confidence in the economy has dropped like a rock, from -20pt just before the shutdown, to -35pt now."

    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>        
        <h3>Ted Cruz <small class="rep">Republican</small></h3>
        <img src="http://media.salon.com/2013/05/ted_cruz2.jpg"/>
        <p>
        A first-term Republican senator from Texas and Tea Party favorite. Just before the shutdown, he railed against Obamacare on the Senate floor in a
        publicity-seeking speech that lasted more than 21 hours and included a Darth Vader impression and reading Dr Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime
        story for his daughters, who watched on TV.
        </p>
        <!-- http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/ted-cruz-texas-maverick -->
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Barack Obama <small class="dem">Democrat</small></h3>
        <p>
        Early on, the president took a position that he would not negotiate at all while the shutdown remained in effect, or while Congress continued to
        threaten a default. Politically, he had little to lose from severing communications, because they were already blocking the two other things that
        matter to him - gun control and immigration - and he was therefore even more reluctant to give up his only other big domestic achievement by delaying
        Obamacare.
        </p>

        <h3>John Boehner <small class="rep">Republican</small></h3>
        <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/John_Boehner_official_portrait.jpg"/>
        <p>
        The Speaker of the House's weakness as party leader was a major factor in the shutdown. His last-minute deal with vice-president Joe Biden averted the
        "fiscal cliff" standoff in January, but angered many on the right of his party. This time, he had little support from majority leader Eric Cantor, who
        is thought to be angling for his job, and Republican whip Kevin McCarthy, who is close to the Tea Party. The majority of House Republicans were not
        previously thought to be so rabidly anti-government, and Boehner failed to use their numerical advantage to further his more cautious instincts.
        </p>

        <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Harry_Reid_official_portrait_2009_crop.jpg"/>
        <p>
        The Democratic Senate majority leader worked out the final deal with Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. Throughout the shutdown, he
        kept the 54 Senate Democrats in the 100-seat chamber unified in rejecting efforts by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to tie
        government funding legislation to changes in the healthcare law.
