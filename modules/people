        <h2>Ted Cruz</h2>
        <p>
        A first-term Republican senator from Texas and Tea Party favorite. Just before the shutdown, he railed against Obamacare on the Senate floor in a
        publicity-seeking speech that lasted more than 21 hours and included a Darth Vader impression and reading Dr Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime
        story for his daughters, who watched on TV.

        <h2>Barack Obama</h2>
        <p>
        Early on, the president took a position that he would not negotiate at all while the shutdown remained in effect, or while Congress continued to
        threaten a default. Politically, he had little to lose from severing communications, because they were already blocking the two other things that
        matter to him – gun control and immigration – and he was therefore even more reluctant to give up his only other big domestic achievement by delaying
        Obamacare.

        <h2>John Boehner</h2>
        <p>
        The Speaker of the House’s weakness as party leader was a major factor in the shutdown. His last-minute deal with vice-president Joe Biden averted the
        “fiscal cliff” standoff in January, but angered many on the right of his party. This time, he had little support from majority leader Eric Cantor, who
        is thought to be angling for his job, and Republican whip Kevin McCarthy, who is close to the Tea Party. The majority of House Republicans were not
        previously thought to be so rabidly anti-government, and Boehner failed to use their numerical advantage to further his more cautious instincts.

        <h2>Harry Reid</h2>
        <p>
        The Democratic Senate majority leader worked out the final deal with Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. Throughout the shutdown, he
        kept the 54 Senate Democrats in the 100-seat chamber unified in rejecting efforts by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to tie
        government funding legislation to changes in the healthcare law.
