    The great US government shutdown of 2013 began, said the Iowa senator Tom Harkin, "like a scene from the Hollywood western High Noon". There was the
    Democrat sheriff Barack Obama, squared off against a gang of southern gunslingers, both sides determined not to give an inch and prepared to blow each
    other's brains out to get what they came for.

    Unfortunately, much of Washington acted as if it had seen this movie before. The metaphorical tumbleweed blowing down the corridors of Capitol Hill
    reflected not a fear of being caught in the crossfire, but a cynical war-weariness that left many lawmakers on the sidelines until it was too late.
    After three years of similar standoffs over the federal budget that were resolved at the last minute, no one could quite believe that this one would
    finish with shots fired.

    For several days leading up to the September 30 deadline for passing new federal spending authorisation, the familiar clash between Republican and
    Democrat leaders was characterised not by dramatic tension but over-rehearsed exchanges of rhetoric. The House speaker, John Boehner, would insist
    that he had "no interest in shutting down the government", then launch another salvo of impossible demands at the Democrats that risked doing just
    that. No matter how many times the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said he would not negotiate in the face of such threats, Republicans would try
    again to attach riders to the spending authorisation aimed at repealing the vexed healthcare legislation known as Obamacare.

    So convinced were both sides that the other was bluffing that the White House is said not to have made serious preparations to deal with a possible
    shutdown until the last 48 hours. A bizarre all-night speech by Senator Ted Cruz on September 25 might have looked like an old-fashioned filibuster
    designed to force the agenda, but was actually just for show once the Senate timetable had long since been set in train. Wall Street barely noticed
    what was going on until the morning of September 30, when the Dow Jones index fell sharply and the penny dropped that Congress might not cut a deal
    this time.
